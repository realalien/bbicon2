* if 'TODO:' is done, add status info like 'TODO:DONE'

* TODO: refactor out run() code from the subclasses of MonitorableTask into upclass.
        since we input different structure of data into specific tasks in run(), 
        I think it would be better to use Map to include info about class name, general ip,
        port if any, other string data. The drawback is that to it depends on each subclass
        to parse the data, and finally, main program to parse the notification data.
        
        
* TODO: exception handle suggestion, e.g. if exception happens, save log and configure file.
* TODO: try to write some test classes and methods.


* IDEA: how to be more productive? Implement the most important, scaffolding the rest!
        from application RemoteMonitor, I spent too much time with unimportant details, 
        e.g. class loader resource loading from top package, logging, 
        nice function but not really useful.
        e.g. manage multiple tasks 
        

 * REQ: use only one icon, prompt once turn red(failure) or green(ok) 
 * TODO: use one DisplayDialog for all the process info? To avoid
        bombard of message!
        
* EXP: see if possible to use enum, and how much is the code modification
